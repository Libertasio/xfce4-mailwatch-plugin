	* xfce4-mailwatch-plugin/trunk/panel-plugin/mailwatch-mailbox-imap.c,
	  xfce4-mailwatch-plugin/trunk/panel-plugin/mailwatch-mailbox.h: use
	  SEARCH UNSEEN to find unread messages, rather than relying on ##
	  RECENT on EXAMINE, as the latter is quite unreliable. there's
	  something wrong when we have more than one IMAP mailbox present.
	  i'm not sure what it is yet, though, and i need to sleep.

	  ok, we now require gnutls 1.2.0 or later. hopefully i'll be able

	  but of course i'm sure it doesn't because i haven't tested it yet.

	  xfce4-mailwatch-plugin/trunk/panel-plugin/mailwatch.h: provide a

	  that would mean making XfceMailwatch into a GObject, which can be
	  messy with unloadable modules. it's easier and safer this way...

2005-04-19 06:49  kelnos

	  barring bugs. tinker with the interface slightly, but nothing
	  major. it all compiles and maybe even works, though there's no way
	  to test it without writing unit tests, and everyone should know by
	  now that i'm far too lazy to do something so productive. sleep

	  through with it. the architecture isn't completely fleshed out;
	  i'm prototyping as i go along. comments welcome.
