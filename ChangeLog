	* xfce4-mailwatch-plugin/trunk/panel-plugin/mailwatch-plugin.c,
	  xfce4-mailwatch-plugin/trunk/panel-plugin/mailwatch.c: ok, so now
	  it compiles. still doesn't do anything.

	  xfce4-mailwatch-plugin/trunk/po/Makefile.in.in,
	  xfce4-mailwatch-plugin/trunk/po/POTFILES.in: this code totally
	  doesn't do anything yet. it probably doesn't even compile. but
	  it's a start, and putting it up in svn means i have to follow
	  through with it. the architecture isn't completely fleshed out;
	  i'm prototyping as i go along. comments welcome.
