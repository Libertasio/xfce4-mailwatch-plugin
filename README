| Xfce4 Mailwatch Plugin |
+------------------------+

The Xfce4 Mailwatch Plugin is a multi-protocol, multi-mailbox mail watcher.
Currently, the protocols supported are:
  * IMAP (SSL/TLS and cleartext)
  * Mbox mail spool (local)
  * Maildir mail spool (local)
POP3 support is planned.

Random list of features:
  * Multiple folder checking support for IMAP.
  * Independent check intervals for each mailbox (only implemented on IMAP).
  * Threaded design; xfce4-panel UI should never freeze or block.
  * Informative button tooltip that tells you the number of new messages in
    each mailbox.
  * Optionally run a command when new mail arrives, or when the panel button
    is clicked.

Currently, gnutls 1.2.0 or greater is required.  This requirement may be
made optional in the future; however, lack of this library will force passwords
to be sent in the clear, and is not recommended.  This plugin should work
with any Xfce version from 4.2.0 onwards.
