Version 1.0.1 (20 Apr 2006):
  Bugfixes:
    * Fix a possible connection failure when using IMAPS or POP3S.
    * Don't compile in the GMail mailbox type if GNUTLS is not available,
      as GMail requires an SSL HTTP connection.

Version 1.0.0 (31 Jan 2006):
  Initial release.  I feel pretty good about it, thus the 1.0.0
  designation.  That means there are no bugs.  Seriously.  Ok, not
  really.
