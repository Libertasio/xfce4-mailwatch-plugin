Version 1.0.2svn:

  Bugfixes:
    * Fix a compiler error on some systems (bug 1822).
    * Fix incorrect getaddrinfo() usage breaking use on NetBSD (bug 3767).
    * Fix possible hang when reading IMAP responses when a selected folder
      is later deleted or unsubscribed.

  Features:
    * Update the new message counts for all mailboxes on startup, rather than
      waiting for the first interval timeout.
    * Document the behavior of forcing a new messsage count update when the
      user double-clicks the icon (patch from Maximilian Schleiss).
    * Add experimental IPv6 support.

Version 1.0.1 (20 Apr 2006):

  Bugfixes:
    * Fix a possible connection failure when using IMAPS or POP3S.
    * Don't compile in the GMail mailbox type if GNUTLS is not available,
      as GMail requires an SSL HTTP connection.

Version 1.0.0 (31 Jan 2006):

  Initial release.  I feel pretty good about it, thus the 1.0.0
  designation.  That means there are no bugs.  Seriously.  Ok, not
  really.
